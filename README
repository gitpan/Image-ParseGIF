DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module parses a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) image into
its component 'parts' (a GIF is essentially made up of one or more 
images - multiple images typically are used for animated gifs).

Why, oh why?

- this module can be used by a WWW/CGI application to provide 'real-time'
feedback to a client without using client-side scripts or undue network
inefficiencies. An example application is provided.

- animated GIFs can be de-animated by simply extracting one frame (typically
the first or last).

I'm sure other uses could be found...

See perldoc Image::ParseGIF for full documentation.

INSTALLATION
------------

To install, unpack the archive and in the newly created directory type:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

Use
        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<location>

to install somewhere other than the default.
