Progress Bar Example
--------------------

Install main.cgi, status.cgi and the progressbar.gif into an appropriate 
web server CGI-bin directory.

Calling main.cgi should result in a 'progress' page, and the thence 
(after a refresh or click) the 'results' page.

The progress page should have the animated progress bar update according 
to the random delays in main.cgi as it does it's "work".

These scripts were tested under Apache 1.3.3, you may need to adjust the 
script URLs to work with your server.

Incidentally, the progressbar.gif is under the same license as the 
Image-ParseGIF module.

Deanimation Example
--------------------

Run deanim.pl across any animated gif/s to extract a random frame of each.
